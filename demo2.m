% Demonstrates the usage of HTM based VLP code
% (Animated version of demo1)
% 
% The script will create an array of emitters and a VLP sensor.
%
% It then plots the received intensity at the sensor when the sensor is
% displaced.

%% Prepare the workspace

% add the path to the projective geometry functions
addpath('../ProjGeom');

% Define the model default values

Nm = 6;                 % Number of meridians in the sensor

%% Create and populate data structures

% Create the emitters array:

% Create the receiver structure:
Receivers = newReceivers(n_Receivers,Ar, Ts, n, Psi, R);

%% Place emitters and receivers in 3D space

% Considering a room with 3mx3mx2m (WxLxH).

Emitters(3).HTM = Em_Base_HTM*RotZ3(4*pi/3)*Trans3(0.5,0,0);

% Receivers are organized in Parallel and Meridians arragement of photo
% detectors, with Nm Meridians and 3 Parallels, in a sphere with
% radius=0.25
PDSensor = vlpCreateSensorParMer(Receivers, Np, Nm, 0.25);

% The sensor is initially placed at point (X,Y) = (0.5,3)
PDSensor = vlpMoveSensor(PDSensor,Trans3(0.5,3,0));

%% Compute A, B and F matrices

A = Receiver2A(PDSensor);
B = Emitter2B(Emitters);
F = EmitRec2F(Emitters, PDSensor);

%% Compute the received power

Pt_v = [Emitters.Pt]';
Pr = A*F*B*Pt_v;

% Get the max value. It will be used for scaling the received power
% graphics
MaxPr0 = max(Pr);

% Update the PDSensor received power
for i=1:numel(PDSensor)
    PDSensor(i).Pr = Pr(i);
end
