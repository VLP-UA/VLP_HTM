%   vlpCreateSensorParMer gets an array of photodetectors PDArray and
%   creates a PD sensor, by placing them in a sphere of radius r
%   (eventually zero) at the intersection of the NParal parallels and
%   NMerid meridians in the sphere surface. The z-axis of the sensor points
%   outward, normal to the sphere surphace.
%
%   The construction does not include the vertical ("north-pole") sensor.
%   The sensor is a hemi-spherical dome, where photo-diodes are regularly
%   placed, over NMerid meridians and NParal paralels. The phase arguments
%   are optional; if included, the photodiode location will not start at
%   zero, but at the angle PMerid (for azimuth) and PParal (for elevation).
%
%   Note that the effect of phase is different in the azimuth and
%   elevation. In azimuth, the phase causes a shift in the position of all
%   sensors. In elevation, the phase is the position of the least elevated
%   sensor and the remaining sensors are equally distributed from the
%   initial point and pi/2 (not including).
%
%   The user must guarantee that the number of receivers in PDArray
%   corresponds to NParal*NMerid
%
%   PDArray can be created with newReceivers()
