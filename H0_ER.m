%   OWC channel gain 
%
%   Computes the DC gain of a optical channel from emitter to receiver
%   following the models defined by Gfeller and Bapst [1] and Barry et al
%   [2]. 
%
%   The position and orientation of emitter and receiver are defined
%   by Homogeneous Transformation Matrices HTM_E and HTM_R. The axis of
%   emitter and receiver are aligned with the respective z axis.
%
%   m is the Lambertian order of the emitter, Ar the sensor area at the
%   receiver; FOV is the semi-angle for the Field of View; n is the
%   internal refractive index of the receiver; Ts is the signal
%   transmission gain of the filter. 
%
%   If FOV is omitted, it defaults to pi/2; if n is omitted, no
%   concentrator gain is considered, and the FOV is defined by obstructing
%   the field of view; if Ts is omitted, it defaults to 1. 
%
%   HTM_E : HTM with position and orientation of emitter;
%   HTM_R : HTM with position and orientation of receiver;
%   m : Lambertian mode number of emitter; 
%   Ar : area of receiver detection surface;
%   FOV : semi-angle for field of view;
%   n : refractive index of non-imaging optical concentrator;
%   Ts : optical filter gain.
